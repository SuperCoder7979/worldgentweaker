# World Gen Tweaker
Welcome to the source code and documentation for World Gen Tweaker, a mod that aims to give users and pack makers total control over the world Generation.
It's not quite there yet, but it's still very powerful.

There are a few example scripts in the example folder. Place these in `config/worldgentweaker/tweaks` to run them.
